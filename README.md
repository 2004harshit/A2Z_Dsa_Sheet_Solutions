# 🧠 DSA Practice – TUF A2Z Sheet

Welcome to my repository of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) solutions, where I am solving problems daily from the [TUF A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/).

My goal is to build strong problem-solving skills, maintain consistency, and track my learning journey publicly. This repo is also part of my effort to keep my GitHub profile active and professional.

## 📌 About the Sheet

The TUF A2Z DSA Sheet is a curated roadmap by [Striver (Raj Vikramaditya)](https://www.youtube.com/c/takeUforward) that covers all essential topics for coding interviews and tech placements.

It covers:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees
- Binary Search
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Graphs
- DP (Dynamic Programming)
- and more...
